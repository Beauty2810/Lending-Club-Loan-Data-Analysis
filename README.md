# Lending-Club-Loan-Data-Analysis
# Description:
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

# Our Goal
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. The "loan_status" column contains our label.

# Data
This dataset contains the full Lending Club data available from their site. The data used contain all the Loans of the Lending Club during the period 2007 - 2018 consisting of > ~1.5M samples and > 150 features.

# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, is an integral part of understanding the LendingClub dataset.
## Loan Status Distribution

We will be considering only two categories, "Fully Paid" and "Charged Off". It is clearly visible that the data is imbalanced and we have to take the actions accordingly.

This plot identifies the distributions of loan interest rate records within the dataset.

Here is a simple count plot for loan grades within the dataset. The most popular grades are B and C. A-graded loans come third. There are few F and G graded loans, probably for the best. However it is important to notice that B and C graded loans occur more often than top rated 'A' loans.

# Data Preprocessing

- Discarding all the columns containing more than 25% null values of the total data
- Imputing null values with suitable feature values
- Converting all date features into datetime datatype and creating separate features containing month and year of that date feature
- Reducing number of feature based on feature importance obtained from Random Forest Classifier
- Converting categorical features to numerical features using label encoding
- Scaling the features for fast convergence of the model
- Spliting the data into training and testing 

# About Model 

We trained a 5-layer Neural Network using Keras having total Trainable params: 194,049. Since, the data was imbalanced, f1_score, precison and recall were taken into consideration for the evaluation of the model. We managed to get f1_score of 99% for the test data.

# Results

Since, the data is highly imbalanced, we can not really rely on the accuracy score. So we have to consider the f1_score, precision and recall.
